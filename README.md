C++ Projects and Code
1. The Game of Life:
I built this project under my independent course work CS106B - Programming Abstractions provided by Stanford University. I am taking this course just to learn Programming Abstractions in depth. 

The Game of Life is a simulation originally conceived by the British mathematician J. H. Conway in 1970 and popularized by Martin Gardner in his Scientific American column. The game models the life cycle of bacteria using a two-dimensional grid of cells. Given an initial pattern, the game simulates the birth and death of future generations of cells using a set of simple rules. In this project, I implemented a simplified version of Conway's simulation and a basic user interface for watching the bacteria grow over time.


2.Serafini: 
Project descriptionPart A: Word Ladders
A word ladder is a bridge between one word and another, formed by changing one letter at a time,
with the constraint that at each step the sequence of letters still forms a valid word. For example,
here is a word ladder connecting the word "code" to the word "data". Each changed letter is
underlined as an illustration:
code → cade → cate → date → data	
This program repeatedly prompts the user for two words and finds a minimum-length ladder linking the words.

Part B: Random Writer
In the second part of this project, I wrote a program that takes in a text file and then (randomly) generates new text in the same style. In effect, this program automates an exercise that writers have used for centuries to improve their style: imitating another writer. 

The program accomplishes the task of imitating a text’s style by building and relying on a large
data structure of word groups called "N-grams." A collection of N-grams will serve as the basis for
the program to randomly generate new text that sounds like it came from the same author as the
input file.
